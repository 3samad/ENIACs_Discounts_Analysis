# ENIACs_Discounts_Analysis

The company is at a crossroads in deciding on discount implementation. The Marketing Team Lead supports discounts, highlighting their potential to attract and satisfy customers, while the main investors worry about the negative effects of aggressive discounts on revenue and market position. Our objective is to use data analysis to shed light on these concerns.

# Business Questions

To address the concerns and provide insights to the company board, we'll focus on answering the following questions:

- How should products be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis?
- What is the distribution of product prices across different categories?
- How many products are being discounted, and what is the magnitude of these discounts as a percentage of product prices?
- How do seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales?
- How could data collection be improved?
